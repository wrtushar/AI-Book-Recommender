This simple project is built using HTML, CSS, and JS.

The website's goal is to get user input to assess their reading habits and personality type, and then recommend 3 books that are most appropriate for their current reading preferences and personality.

The data collected through a simple HTML form, which is styled using CSS, is sent to Google's Gemini AI using an API.

The results are fetched and displayed to the user.

Neither the data collected nor the data generated by the AI is stored anywhere, as there is no backend for this website.

I didn't plan to include any backend in the app, as it wasn't required for the basic functionality I wanted the website to have.

However, I might add the option for users to sign up and log in to view what they were recommended in the past and also allow them to rate the AI's recommendations.
